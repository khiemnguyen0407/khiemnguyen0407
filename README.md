## Hi there ðŸ‘‹      

<!--
**khiemnguyen0407/khiemnguyen0407** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I am a lecturer at University of Glasgow
- ðŸŒ± My research interests are in Applied Mathematics and Computational Mechanics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on problems involving multiscale methods, multiscale materials, and data-driven problems.
- ðŸ‘‹ My teaching at University of Glasgow:
     1. Introduction to Programming: Basics of Python, plotting, object-oriented programming and NumPy in Python.
     2. Advanced Programming and Software Engineering: Basics of C++, Object-oriented programming in C++, Basics of bash and makefile
     3. Deep Learning: Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and their applications
-
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: khiem.nguyen@glasgow.ac.uk
- âš¡ Fun fact: Students normally comment "Khiem is funny." after each semester. I hope it is a good comment, not a negative comment for my bad teaching.
